Youtube Red Scrollbar

I've made this after I got tired ot the same generic looking scrollbar that Youtube offers. I've customised it to match the Youtube red branding and optimised it for the dark theme. I would not recommend using this with the light/white theme.

Once you get used to it, it's hard to go back to the standard version.

The theme applies only to [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com).
